Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. It's particularly useful when you have a small dataset for your target task.
Here's a conceptual example using PyTorch:

import torch
import torchvision.models as models
from torch import nn

def create_transfer_learning_model(num_classes):
    # Load a pre-trained ResNet model
    model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
    
    # Freeze all layers
    for param in model.parameters():
        param.requires_grad = False
    
    # Replace the last fully connected layer
    num_ftrs = model.fc.in_features
    model.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, num_classes)
    
    return model

# Usage
model = create_transfer_learning_model(num_classes=10)
print(model)
