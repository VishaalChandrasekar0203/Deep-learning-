Deep learning

A machine learning technology called deep learning teaches computers to learn by doing what comes easily to people. Driverless cars use deep learning as a vital technology to recognize stop signs and tell a pedestrian from a lamppost apart. It is essential for voice control on consumer electronics including hands-free speakers, tablets, TVs, and smartphones. Recently, deep learning has attracted a lot of interest, and for good reason. It is producing outcomes that were previously unattainable.

By the process of "deep learning," a computer model can be taught to carry out categorization tasks from images, text, or sound. Modern precision can be attained by deep learning models, sometimes even outperforming human ability. A big collection of labeled data and neural network topologies are used to train models.
