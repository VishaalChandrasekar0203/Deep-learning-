A larger family of machine learning techniques built on artificial neural networks and representation learning includes deep learning. Unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised learning are all possible. [2]

Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers
have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs,
where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.
